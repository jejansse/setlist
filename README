Set list generate
=================

A friend of mine who plays in the progressive metal band Vermilion asked how he could easily generate a set list based on a number of constraints, such as limiting the number of guitar switching during songs. The result is this Answer Set Program that should work with DLV.

# Running it:

Using (DLV)[http://www.dlvsystem.com/] you can simply run it by doing

    ./dlv facts.lp setlist.lp -filter='setlist' -n=0

To alter the number of songs to select, the songs that can be selected and the guitars per song just alter the facts.lp file.
